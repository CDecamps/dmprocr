\usage{
dmTable(data, tumoral_ref, control_ref)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A matrix of row methylation data with TCGA sample ids as column names and probes ids as row names.}

\item{tumoral_ref}{a vector of ids corresponding to tumoral samples.}

\item{control_ref}{a vector of ids corresponding to control samples.}
}
\description{
Generate differential methylation data table from beta values. It basically extract all tumorous samples and controls. Then it computes the difference between each tumorous and the mean of control.
