\usage{
clustdmProfile(mat, fill_NA = TRUE, geneLabels)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{a distance Matrix}

\item{fill_NA}{boolean specifying if NA should be imputed, need to be kept TRUE for now if there are NA in the matrix}

\item{geneLabels}{A vector of genes names or id, can be extracted from a list of dmProfile with getProfileId}
}
\value{
A list of 2 object, the hclust result and a list containing the name of genes for each vector
}
\description{
Plot a dendrogram from a distance matrix, select cluster by clicks on the graphical window, click finish to get a list of geneNames in each cluster selected.
}
\details{
Carefull, the function has been generating errors with less than 20 genes in the distance matrix.
